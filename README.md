**Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?**
  The client for the project was DriverPass which is a company owned by Liam. They wanted a system designed that could allow for customers to view and book driving appointments online. They also wanted them to be able to take online practice tests. Liam wanted the ability to see what classes were scheduled with which driver and be able to remotely access and download reports from the system.
  
**What did you do particularly well?**
  During this project, I learned how to diagram the ideas I had for the various systems. I think they came out having a clear representation of the funtions and are easy to follow and read. These are good tools to use in the future that can help bring ideas into a visual context.
  
**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**
  I would organize my UML class diagram better. I would like to see it more streamlined and arrange the use cases in a way that the connections to the various actors do not overlap and look messy.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**
  I read the interview with the client multiple times and broke it down into individual needs for the system. Once I identified a user need, I carefully read through the entire interview to see if they requested anymore details or specifications about it. It's important to consider the user's needs becuause they will be the one using the system, not the development team. If it isn't friendly or intuitive for the user, the system will not have met it's objectives.

**How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**
  I approach designing software by working on smaller parts rather than the whole project at once. I gather all the information I can about what is needed and then plan out each part based on what I think is logical. Once each part is created, I then iterate on it to try to get it optimized an functional. I will continue to implement any valuable techniques and strategies I learn as I move through my future courses.
